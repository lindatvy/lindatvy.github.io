  summary: My favorite club of all! I collaborate with SWE board members to organize our annual WOW! Event, where our goal is to encourage and inform female high school students about the plethora of opportunities in engineering. Rather then explaining, we literally show students the possibilities of engineering through hands-on workshop and talks by established female engineer leaders.

  summary: The club provides opportunities for students to attend SASE&#8217;s national conferences and meet chapters from other local colleges. The most recent event was the Intel Networking Conference where the host gathered Intel engineering and business employees to discuss their own transition from college to real-life work. Their success stories made us see the limitless potential for growth in the field and sparked a lot of inspiration for the students- including myself.
  
- organization: Bridging Engineering Students Transition 
  role: Mentor
  date: Spring 2016 ~ Fall 2016
  summary: BEST&#8217;s purpose is to help freshman and sophomore engineering students transition into college and provide mentorship academically and socially. SJSU offers many amazing programs and resource centers that I wish I had known about when starting my freshman year. As a mentor, I inform my mentees about these opportunities, so they can make the most of what college has to offer.
